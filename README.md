This repository contains a final project for the Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree.

## Running the project

The project comes with a handy `start.sh` script, which is designed to create a new `venv` environment in the project directory, install all dependencies from `requirements.txt` and then start the jupyter notebook.

The script was validated to run on both Linux and MacOS with Python 3.11.9. On Windows you might have to manally replicate the commands from the script.

### Pre-requisites

- Linux or MacOS
- Python 3.11.9

### Starting project

To start the project please run `./start.sh` in the terminal. It will automatically open Jupyter Notebook
